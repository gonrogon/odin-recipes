# Odin Recipes

A simple HTML/CSS practice project: a cooking recipe website. 

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, designed to reinforce foundational web development skills. My aim is to strengthen programming skills in HTML and CSS, with a focus on reviewing core concepts and improving proficiency in these technologies.
